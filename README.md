## 18th May 2015 - Functional JavaScript and the Lodash Framework ##
How the Functional aspects of JavaScript, and use of the Lodash framework helped me de-odorize my code

1. Our requirement: Querying, slicing and dicing
2. A typical JavaScript object (self-revealing)
3. Problems of mutability, coupling, and cohesion
4. A move away from objects: Returning higher-order functions
5. Enter Lodash (intro to)
6. Handling results: Killing those 'ifs' (pattern matching)
7. Getting closer to functional purity
8. More advanced use of Lodash (currying etc.)
